This is a placeholder for a sample image file.
In a real scenario, this would be a binary image file.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Use any image file from your computer
2. Or create a simple text file and rename it to .jpg
3. The system will handle the file upload regardless

The important thing is testing the upload functionality!
